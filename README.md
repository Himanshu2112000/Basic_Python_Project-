## String Indexing:
String indexing provides a powerful way to manipulate and access individual characters or substrings within a string in 
Python. string indexing is a fundamental concept in Python that allows you to work with individual characters or substrings
within strings, enabling various string manipulation operations.

### Question 1 
How can you access the first character of a string using indexing?

### Question 2
Can you retrieve the last character of a string using negative indexing?

## List Operations:
list operations provide various ways to manipulate and access elements within lists, making lists versatile and powerful data structures in Python.

### Question 6 
 How do you access elements in a list using indexing?

## Dictionary Operations:
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionary operations allow you to manipulate, access, and perform actions on these key-value pairs.Dictionary operations in Python involve various actions you can perform on dictionaries, which are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

### Question 10
How do you access the value associated with a key in a dictionary?
